# Handwritten-Character-and-digit-recgnition-along-with-sing-language-recognition
This project is designed to help blind and deaf lead an eassier life while doing real time detection.
Right now the focus is now doing detection on input image but will soon do detection using camera.
In this project, user can upload image of digit/character/sign language and the program will recognise it and give an ouput as audio for digit and character for the blind
